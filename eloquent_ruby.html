Book Review Pages

You will then create a book review page template, using Eloquent Ruby by Russ Olsen as your example. The content for the page is provided in the content folder by the textfile Eloquent_Ruby.txt. The book review page will have the same overall structure as index.html except the main content section will structure the information inside of the text file. The page should also include the image of the book, included in the images folder.
